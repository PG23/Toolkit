A simple, open-source "Toolkit" app that displays data from available sensors.  

It includes:
- Geolocation coordinates
- Orientation, including a simple compass and spirit level
- Accelerometer data (including gravity)
- Proximity
- Ambient light intensity

It has been tested in FXOS v2.5, and will only display data if the required sensors are present.  For example, the compass will not work unless your device has an internal compass.  

The source code is available at the link below.  I used this app to start learning HTML/CSS/JS, so please be kind in any comments!  Particular thanks to Mozilla's empty app template, Robnyman's Boilerplate app and Beardfu's Compass app for inspiration.
